**Project Overview**
The Bike Store Sales Analysis project is designed to analyze sales data from a bike store to uncover key insights into the business's performance. By utilizing SQL, this project provides valuable information on product sales, customer behavior, staff performance, and store effectiveness. The analysis focuses on identifying trends, top-performing products, and customer preferences to help inform business strategies.

**Key Features**
-Top Selling Products: Identification of the top 5 best-selling products based on total quantity sold.
-Yearly Sales Analysis: Calculation of total sales per year to identify trends over time.
-Staff Performance: Evaluation of staff performance based on sales across different product categories.
-Discount Analysis: Calculation of average discounts given by product category.
-Brand Performance: Identification of the brands with the highest sales.
-Regional Sales Analysis: Analysis of customer orders by region to determine the most active areas.
-Store Performance: Calculation of total sales and average order values for each store.
-Customer Insights: Identification of the customer with the most orders and analysis of common product pairs purchased together.

SQL Queries
The analysis is conducted using SQL queries that join multiple tables in the database, including products, orders, customers, staff, stores, and order_items. Each query is designed to address a specific business question, such as determining the top-selling products or evaluating staff performance. The SQL queries used in this analysis are included in this repository.
